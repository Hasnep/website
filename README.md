# My Website

My static website is generated using Gatsby.js and hosted on [Netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/).
It uses the GitHub API to automatically update the projects' pages with the latest information.
I thought this would make me write more descriptive readmes, but as this text proves, it didn't work.

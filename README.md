# My Website

My [static website](https://ha.nnes.dev/) is generated by my static site generator and hosted on [Netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/).
It uses the GitHub API to automatically update the blogposts and project pages with the latest information.

I wrote about it [on my blog](https://ha.nnes.dev/blog/ssg-functional-programming/).

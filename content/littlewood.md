Plotting roots of monic Littlewood polynomials (and monic polynomials with coefficients of 1 and other numbers).

## Explanation

Littlewood polynomials are polynomials with coefficients of either 1 or -1.
Monic polynomials have the first coefficient as 1.
This script plots the roots of every N-th degree monic Littlewood polynomial on the complex plane.

My dissertation for my master's in maths at the University of Exeter, titled "Can statistics help us to understand deep learning?"

## Abstract

> Machine learning and deep neural networks have seen widespread success in many applications and are set to play a larger rôle in modern society — sometimes visibly, as with driverless cars, but in some cases more discreetly, such as the use of machine learning algorithms in the U.S. judicial system.
> Due to their hierarchical structure, deep neural networks are very difficult or impossible for humans to understand, which could cause problems when a machine learning algorithm does something unforeseen when in a position of power.
> This project uses a simple nonlinear function as an example to train a deep neural network and then applies multiple regression and Gaussian processes to the output of the neural network to try and extract human understandable meaning.
> LASSO regularisation is used to reduce the regression model to a more human understandable form and is then combined with a Gaussian process to fit the neural network better.

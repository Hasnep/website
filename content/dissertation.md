My dissertation for my master's in maths at the University of Exeter, titled "Can statistics help us to understand deep learning?"

## Abstract

> Machine learning and deep neural networks have seen widespread success in many of modern life — sometimes visibly, as with driverless cars, but in some cases more discreetly, such as the use of machine learning algorithms in the U.S. judicial system.
> Due to their hierarchical structure, deep neural networks are a ‘black box’ which no human can understand, which could cause problems when a machine learning algorithm does something unforeseen.
> Statistical methods such as Gaussian processes may offer a way to look inside this black box, as they offer a similar flexibility and wide range of uses, and are much more easily interpreted by humans.
> In this project, a simple non-linear function was used to train a deep neural network and then multiple regression and Gaussian processes were used to model the output of the neural network.
> Regularisation methods such as LASSO were used to reduce the regression model to a more human understandable form, which was then used as the mean function of a Gaussian process to further improve the fit of the model.
